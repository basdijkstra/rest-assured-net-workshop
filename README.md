RestAssured.Net workshop
==================
For those of you looking to gain some experience working with [RestAssured.Net](https://github.com/basdijkstra/rest-assured-net/), here are all the materials from a workshop I've created and delivered multiple times to good reviews. Feel free to use, share and adapt these materials as you see fit.

What do I need?
---
A machine with .NET 6, .NET 7 or .NET 8 and an IDE of your choice. That's it.

What API is used for the exercises?
---
All API calls that are used in the examples and exercises have been mocked using [WireMock.Net](https://github.com/WireMock-Net/WireMock.Net). WireMock.Net is included in this project as a dependency, so there's no need for additional setup.

Running the mock server
---
The mock server used to respond to the API calls you're making in the exercises is started and stopped automatically before the tests are run, so you don't have to take care of this yourself.


Slides
---
The .pptx/.pdf/.odp file in the root folder contains all slides from the workshop. Again, feel free to use, share and adapt them to fit your own requirements.

Comments? Saying thanks?
---
Feel free to file an issue here or send me an email at bas@ontestautomation.com.

I'd rather have you deliver the workshop instead...
---
Sure, I'd love to. Again, send me an email and I'll be happy to discuss options. In house or at your conference, I'm sure we can work something out.
